# Climbing the Data Science Mountain
'It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.' -Albert Einstein

Choosing to seriously take on data science journey is no small decision for me, not only because I have been on a good career path, but also because I know I almost have to start from scratch on every technical skills required by data science discipline. I have a peak to conquer when I am not adequately equipped. But here I am, starting the climb because I believe the ultimate reward is waiting for me on the top.

Can you predict how the week would look like when you see this face on Monday morning? (BTW, he is our puppy who just joined the family on Sunday). It's going to be great! Well, that's when you don't have enough observations to make prediction. There are two words to describe how the week went: Sleepless and Overwhelmed. But hold on, did I say there will be rewards even though I just started climbing the mountain? It was very rewarding to put the presentation together with my teammates for  Project Benson. The process allowed us to have a peek on real life data science project.It is about collecting data, exploring data, forming hypothesis or business ideas, cleaning and analyzing data to find what we're looking for, present results, iterations to fine-tune analysis.

And Epsilon brought so much joy in our life even when he still pees and poops all over the place, he can now sit on command!
